# Satellite Communication Simulator - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This project is a React + TypeScript web application that simulates 24-hour satellite communication between a user-configured Beacon satellite and the Iridium constellation. The simulation visualizes the orbits, calculates contact windows, and presents statistics about the communication.

## Key Components

### 1. Orbit Configuration Form (`OrbitForm.tsx`)

This component allows users to configure:
- Beacon mode (sun-synchronous, non-polar, or custom)
- Altitude, inclination, and local solar time parameters
- Antenna half-angles for both the beacon and Iridium satellites
- Selection of one of the 66 Iridium satellites

### 2. Simulation Engine (`simulate.ts` and Web Worker)

The core of the application is the simulation engine that:
- Calculates satellite positions using orbital mechanics
- Computes line-of-sight vectors between satellites
- Tests satellite antenna alignments
- Produces contact flags for each second in the 24-hour period
- Calculates statistics like total contact time and outage events

The simulation runs in a Web Worker to keep the UI responsive during heavy calculations.

### 3. 3D Visualization (`OrbitViewer.tsx`)

The visualization component uses three.js via react-three-fiber to:
- Render a 3D scene with Earth at the center
- Display the Beacon and selected Iridium satellite orbits
- Animate the satellites over time
- Highlight when the satellites are in communication

### 4. Results Panel (`ResultsPanel.tsx` and `TimelinePlot.tsx`)

These components display the simulation results:
- Total contact time and percentage
- Number of handshakes (contact events)
- Total and average outage times
- Initial satellite positions
- A timeline visualization of contact windows

## Implementation Details

### Orbital Mechanics

The simulation uses these key calculations:
- Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinate system for position calculations
- Circular orbit approximation for satellite positions
- Conversion between orbital parameters (inclination, RAAN, phase angle)
- Specific calculations for sun-synchronous orbits

### Data Flow

1. User inputs parameters in the `OrbitForm` component
2. Form submission triggers the simulation engine via `simulationEngine.runSimulation()`
3. The simulation runs in a Web Worker, calculating positions and contact periods
4. Results are returned to the main thread and stored in state
5. The 3D view animates the satellites based on the simulation time
6. The results panel displays the statistics and contact timeline

### Technologies Used

- **React**: For the UI components and state management
- **TypeScript**: For type safety across the application
- **Web Workers**: For running the simulation in a separate thread
- **Three.js / React Three Fiber**: For 3D visualization of the orbits
- **Satellite.js**: For advanced orbital calculations (to be integrated)

## Future Enhancements

1. **TLE Integration**: Add support for loading actual TLE data for the Iridium constellation
2. **Advanced Orbit Visualization**: Add orbit traces, ground tracks, and visibility cones
3. **More Detailed Simulation**: Factor in atmospheric drag, orbital perturbations, etc.
4. **Multiple Satellites**: Support for simulating communication with multiple satellites simultaneously
5. **Save/Load Configurations**: Allow users to save and load different simulation scenarios

## Mathematical Basis

The simulation is based on established orbital mechanics principles:
- Kepler's laws of planetary motion
- Circular orbit position and velocity calculations
- Vector mathematics for line-of-sight and dot product calculations
- Antenna half-angle constraints for realistic communication limits

## Conclusion

The Satellite Communication Simulator provides an interactive way to understand and visualize satellite communications. By combining accurate orbital mechanics with 3D visualization, it offers insights into satellite coverage, communication windows, and the effects of different orbital parameters on communication reliability.
